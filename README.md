## General info
First HTML site

## The content of the task

* Insert the HTML structure into the index.html.
* Add the title of the page (<title>), then place the same title in the 
first degree heading in the body of the page (the largest).
* Create 3 paragraphs of text and a lower level header above H1.
* Fill headers and paragraphs with content (as the "About me" page).
* Add at least 2 working links to your favorite pages so that they 
open in a new tab, not the same. To do this, use the target = "_ blank" 
attribute inside the <a> tag.
* Add at least 2 photos to your site, e.g. from the free pexels service. 
Download a link to the photo you like in this way and insert it in HTML using 
"<img src = "...">" as the source of the photo.
* If the page is ready, copy the contents of the index.html file from the task editor, 
create a new file in the notepad, paste the code and save it on your computer's desktop. 
Of course, save the new file as index.html.
* Change any text in the page's code from the text editor level and save the changes. 
Run the file, it will open in the browser. It works? :)
* Now change the file here to the W3C validator and press "Check".
* Make a screen of the validation results using the screenShu application. 
Take a screenshot of the screen in the HTML structure (editor) in the form of a link to 
this screenshot (use the <a> tag). So that the mentor watching your project could click on 
this link and see the results of validation in this way.
